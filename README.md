# flutter_app

This flutter application is a prototype for a Tower Defence game. We currently have the basic
layout of the game, timer, lives, and one enemy. The player is able to place 4 different types of
towers around the path but the towers currently cant do damage to the enemy so we have
not implemented the score or tower upgrades.

How to play:
click on one of the four tower buttons to choose what type of tower you would like to place 
then click the square you would like to place your tower in. Each tower has a price and if you do
not have enough gold then you will not be able to place anymore towers
(currently all towers cost 20 gold)

if the game was complete the towers would damage the enemy and you would receive gold and
score points.
